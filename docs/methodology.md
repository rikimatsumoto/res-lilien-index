LI= SQRT(Summation {s_(irt)} * [ln{x_(irt)/x_(irt-1)} - ln{X_(rt)/X-(rt-1)}] ^2)

where s_(irt) = {x_(irt)/X_(rt)} is the sector i share in total regional employment in time period t, 
ln{x_(irt)/x_(irt-1)} is the employment growth in sector i in time period t, and ln{X_(rt)/X_(rt-1)} is the employment growth in the entire region in time period t.
